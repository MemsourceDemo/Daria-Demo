          <div class="centered-div">
            <p>Support teams have a lot of knowledge about customer issues—and the best way to solve them. Zendesk Guide is a smart <a href="/guide/features/knowledge-base-software/">knowledge base</a> that helps tap into that institutional knowledge and puts it to work. With Guide, you can quickly build a <a href="/guide/features/help-center/">customizable help center</a>, <a href="/guide/features/community-software/">online community</a>, and <a href="/guide/features/customer-portal-software/">customer portal</a> so customers get better self-service and agents see improved efficiency and faster resolution. And since it’s the only knowledge base native to Zendesk, it integrates seamlessly with Zendesk Support.</p>

            <h3>A powerful pair</h3>
            <p> Zendesk Support works with Guide to make your <a href="/guide/features/knowledge-base-software/">knowledge base</a> smarter. When customers use self-service, Guide tracks that activity and sends it to Support in the form of contextual insights in <a href="/apps/pathfinder/">Pathfinder</a> that help agents analyze customer activity and solve tickets faster. This info is fed back into Guide, which continuously improves and refines the info it offers to both agents and customers.</p>

            <p>With Guide, setting up a well-stocked <a href="/guide/features/knowledge-base-software/">knowledge base</a> is easy. The <a href="/guide/features/knowledge-capture-app/">Knowledge Capture app</a> allows agents to turn every customer interaction into new content, flag old content for improvements, and even search for articles to share in tickets. Content managers can also rely on their entire team to contribute to content, including everything from <a href="/resources/leverage-entire-team-create-best-self-service-content/">approval and publishing workflows</a> to vetting new articles and improving upon old ones — ensuring the best content is presented to both customers and agents.</p>
